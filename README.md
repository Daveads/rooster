## Installation

Rooster currently works on OSX, Linux and BSD.

To install, open a terminal and run this command:

```shell
curl -sSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/conradkleinespel/rooster/master/install.sh' | sh
```

If the install script fails, make sure you have these programs/packages installed: `sha256sum`, `tar`, `pkg-config`, `libx11-dev` and `libxmu-dev`. Then try running the install script again.

Once you have installed Rooster, you can view documentation with:
```shell
rooster --help
```
