# Rooster â€” the simple password manager for geeks

Rooster is a simple and secure password manager for geeks.

By geeks, we mean those that are not afraid to use the command line.

## Installation

The installation depends on [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html) being installed on your system.

Once you have those installed, you can run the following command to install Rooster:
```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/conradkleinespel/rooster.git
```

Once you have installed Rooster, you can view documentation with:
```shell
rooster --help
```

If Rooster does not work the way you expect it to, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/conradkleinespel/rooster/issues/new) and tell us about it.
